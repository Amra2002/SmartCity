                       one does not have all the books on display. You access these books by scanning their catalog and
                       requesting for a book, which they then fetch it for you from their backend. They have more academic 
                       books, magazines, and newspapers. They even have every issue of National Geographic magazines since 
                       1984! And the best part? There are no entry or membership fees! </p>
