<h3>Bombay, now known as Mumbai, the city of dreams and the city that never sleeps has a vast history that is turning to obscurity. Even though many of you don’t know the history of Mumbai, but the history of this dreamy city is something that the Mumbaikars are passionate about. </h3><br>

<h3>The name “Mumbai” is a nickname for “Mumbadevi”, a local Goddess.
 This city with a beautiful and rich heritage is originally built on a group of seven islands- Colaba, Worli, Mazagaon, Parel, Mahim, Old Woman’ Island, and Bombay Island. 
These islands were embodied in the Maurya Empire which was under the Buddhist Emperor Ashoka of Magadha. </h3>

<h3>But soon after the death of the king Ashoka, these islands came under Satavahanas who are knowns as Andhras in Puranas i.e., an ancient Indian dynasty. And then the islands were ruled by different rulers after the end of another. This city has seen a lot of ruling and indulge a great and rich history.

It was 1543 AD when the islands were seized by the Portuguese from Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. The islands were ruled by the Portuguese till 1661. On May 8, 1661, the islands were yielded as a dowry to Charles II of England who married to Catherine of Portugal. So it was then when Bombay became a British possession due to a part of the dowry.</h3>

<h3><p>In 1668, King Charles II gave up the isles to the East India Company with annual rent and soon the city was named as “Bombay”. Slowly and steadily within 7-8 years, the city grew and the population increased from 10,000 to 60,000. After seeing this rapid growth, the East India Company decided to move its headquarters from Surat to Bombay.

The period of Industrialization started when the then-governor William Hornby incorporated a project despite opposition from the East India Company. Soon after the city saw a lot of changes and an indefinite number of civil engineering projects on the way. And this was the start of the Industrial Revolution where the seven isles were finally turned into one city during 1845. Followed, in 1853, the first railway connection between Bombay and Thane was achieved. After the revolt in 1857, the East India Company lost its control over Bombay.

In 1869, Bombay became one of the major ports in India after the Suez Canal was accommodated which created a connection between the Bombay and the rest of the world.

Soon the Hindu-Muslim riots broke out again which resulted in massacres and turmoil all over the city. And followed by the Indian freedom movement started from the 1890s and lasted till 1940s till India got independence from the British rule.</p></h3>
